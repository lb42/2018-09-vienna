                    compilation of fragments from different works. It covers the period from the
                    creation of the world, to the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the fall of
                    Constantinople, Kievan and Moscow Rus and ends with the coronation of the first
                    Romanov tsar, Mikhail Fedorovich in 1613.. </head>

                            <foliation>
                                <p>The manuscript has two foliations, both in upper right corner of
                                    pages: one foliation in Russian numerals in ink, most likely
                                    done by Ivan Něčaev (the same ink and the same probationes
                                    pennae as on front pastedown). The Russian foliation runs: i +
                                    (1)(1) - 7, 24 - 202, 204, 203, 205 - 209, 211, 213 - 482, 482 -
                                    488 + i; ff. 8-23 (= quires 2 and 3) are missing; conjugate
                                    leaves 203 and 204 are rearranged probably in connection with
                                    the re-binding. The modern foliation in pencil was probably
                                    applied by the binder in connection with the rebinding. It is
                                    continuous and does not take the Russian foliation in
                                    consideration. The first text carrying leaf is f. 6 presumably
                                    because the front pastedown and the flyleaves (today ff. i and
                                    ii) were once paginated 1-5. This foliation runs: i-ii + 6-474
                                    (+ ff. 56b; 191b) + iii.</p>
                            </foliation>
                            <collation>Collation is disturbed and uncertain; 59 quires numbered with
                                cyrillic numerals: I: 8 (ff. ii-12); IV-XXXXVIII: 8 (ff. 13-371);
                                LIX: 8 (ff. 372-379); LX; 7 (ff. 380-386, 3rd leaf is missing but
                                without text lacunae); LXI-LXXI: 8 (ff. 387-474). Quires 2 and 3 are
                                missing with lacunae in the text; numbering on quire 7 contains a
                                crossed out "6" (f. 37r); quires 1, 59, 60 och 62 contain numberings
                                on the verso pages of the last leaves (ff. 12v, 379v, 386v, 394v);
                                quires 49-58 have probably never existed, however the last leaf of
                                quire 48 (f. 371) is numbered 58 in cyrillic numerals. No

                        <p>Medeltidshandskrift 40 was donated to Lund university library in 1722
                            (present and former call numbers on front pastedown) by Carl Schultén
                            (1677-1730), professor of theology, together with another Russian
                            manuscript (Medeltidshandskrift 39), a gospel book from the 16th
                            century. There was a colonel Ivan Konstantinovich Nechaev (d. 1719) who
                            could have been the owner of Medeltidshandskrift 40. He was an officer
                            in the Russian army and he may well have fought against the Swedes in
                            Estonia in the early 18th century. Schultén worked at the university of
                            Pärnu in 1704-1709. Thus the assumption that Schultén could have come
                            across the book during his stay in Estonia, is not improbable.</p>
